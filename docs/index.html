		        <p>The best way to learn a language is to listen to other people speak that language. Try to repeat what you hear and mind their feedback. Gradually, you will progress from individual words to phrases and to complete sentences. The more you speak, the faster you will learn.</p>
		        <p>With <strong>Domain Storytelling</strong> you can employ the same principle when learning a new domain language. Let domain experts tell their domain stories. While listening, you record the domain stories using a pictographic language. The domain experts can see immediately if you understand their story correctly. After very few stories, you are able to talk about the people, tasks, tools, work items, and events in that domain.

          <h2>The pictographic language</h2>
          <p>To record Domain Stories, we need a vocabulary and pictograms that represent the vocabulary:</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="three columns">
          <span class="icon"><img src="images/icon_actor.png" /></span>
          <p>Domain Stories are told from an <strong>actor</strong>'s perspective. Actors may be a person, a group, or a software system. Hence, we use different pictograms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="three columns">
          <span class="icon"><img src="images/icon_work_object.png" /></span>
          <p>Actors create, work with, and exchange <strong>work objects</strong> and <strong>information about work objects</strong> such as documents and messages. The pictograms represent the work object’s medium.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="three columns">
          <span class="icon"><img src="images/icon_arrows.png" /></span>
          <p>The actor's <strong>activities</strong> are depicted as arrows.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="three columns">
          <span class="icon"><img src="images/icon_annotation.png" /></span>
          <p>Textual <strong>annotations</strong> are useful to document assumptions, variations and exceptions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

	    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <p><br />To add a specific meaning to a pictogram, we name it with a term from the domain language:<br />
          An actor <strong>cashier</strong>, a work object <strong>screen plan</strong>, an activity <strong>confirms</strong> etc. </p>
          <p>In the examples on this website, we use about a dozen of Google's Material icons that represent typical office work. You should compile your own set of pictograms that fits to your domain.</p>

    <div class="container">

          <h3>Now we can build a sentence...</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Every sentence starts with an <strong>actor</strong> who initiates an <strong>activity</strong>.</li>
                <li>Next, you need a <strong>work object</strong> or a piece of information that the <strong>actor</strong> does something with. Choose a pictogram that represents the medium of that work object (e.g. a paper icon, an email icon or a bubble for verbal information).</li>
                <li>Connect the <strong>actor</strong> and the <strong>work object</strong> with an <strong>arrow</strong>. Name the <strong>arrow</strong> according to the <strong>activity</strong> (e.g. creates, edits, sends).</li> <li>If the <strong>activity</strong> involves another <strong>actor</strong>, draw another <strong>arrow</strong> from the <strong>work object</strong> to that <strong>actor</strong>. Often, a preposition (e.g. to, with) makes a good name for the <strong>arrow</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5 class="m-1">So the basic syntax is: subject - predicate - object.</h5>

          <h3>...and tell a story</h3>
              <p>
                By numbering the arrows, we express the sequence of activities.
                Every actor should appear only once in a Domain Story. However, if you use the same work object in several sentences, you have to draw it several times (maybe with different pictograms).

                <p><strong>Domain Storytelling</strong> helps you to find meaningful examples of what actually happens in a business process. Maybe you noticed that the visual language does not contain any symbols for cases, exceptions and parallelism. <br />Instead, the context of a Domain Story is defined with assumptions:
                <br /><em>“Let’s assume the customer calls. How do you take her reservation?”</em></p>
                <p>While you record the story, additional assumptions might be necessary:
                <br /><em>“Assuming that there are enough seats available, what do you do next?”</em>
                <br />Important alternatives and error cases deserve their own Domain Story.
                <br />Usually, very few Domain Stories are sufficient to understand a business process. After recording Domain Stories for a few processes, you will become fluent in the domain language.

	    			<strong>What happens next?
	    			<br/>Where do you get this information from?
	    			<br/>How do you determine what to do next?</strong>

    		  <br />Once the story is finished, the moderator checks if all participants agree upon the recorded Domain Story.  Objections, important variations, edge cases and so on are not dismissed but written down and may trigger another Domain Story.

        <p>Let's pick up the example we used earlier, but this time we add a little bit more context: Imagine a chain of cinemas has asked us to develop an app that allows their customers to make reservations and buy electronic tickets. To familiarize ourselves with the domain, we set up a Domain Storytelling workshop. We visit one of the cinemas and invite an employee who works at the ticket counter, the local cinema manager, and an administrator who manages the existing ticket system.

          <p>It will take more than one workshop to gather enough knowledge about the domain. We could run another workshop with someone from marketing and someone who is in charge of the screen plans. Or maybe some of the cinemas have a special focus (e.g. festivals, art movies) and work differently. As a rule of thumb, 3-5 workshops should produce enough knowledge so that we can communicate with the domain experts about their needs, requirements and problems.</p>

          <p>Since Eric Evans <sup>[1]</sup> coined the term <strong>Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</strong>, an ever growing DDD community builds software that reflects its domain. If you are new to DDD, we recommend <a href="https://leanpub.com/theanatomyofdomain-drivendesign" target="_blank">this concise introduction</a> by Scott Millett.

          <h5>“Domain-Driven Design is a language and domain-centric approach to software design for complex problem domains.” <span class="medium-text">– Scott Millet <sup>[3]</sup></span></h5>

        <h3>Get familiar with your domain</h3>
        <div class="ten offset-by-one columns">
          <p>Domain Storytelling is a <strong>knowledge crunching</strong> technique. The people who participate in a Domain Storytelling workshop will get new insights into the domain. The resulting Domain Stories express their shared understanding. Other ways to build domain knowledge include scenarios <sup>[4]</sup> and scenario exploring<sup>[1]</sup>. Domain Stories help you to come up with scenarios and to visualize them.</p>
          <p>When you approach a domain, we recommend to start broad. Invite people from several departments to create coarse-grained Domain Stories. Do not limit yourself by existing organizational boundaries (or perceived bounded contexts, if you already familiar with DDD) and record Domain Stories that bridge departments. See <a href="#dst-explained">Domain Storytelling Explained</a> for guidelines and examples of Domain Stories that provide an overview of a domain.

        <h3>Strategic Design</h3>
        <div class="ten offset-by-one columns">
          <p>If you want to develop software, you need more than just an understanding of a domain. You need rich domain models that express deep knowledge. But the more details you add, the more ambiguous and complex your models will get. In DDD, we make our models manageable by partitioning the domain into bounded contexts. Every bounded context has its own set of models and ultimately its own, unambiguous ubiquitous language.
          </p>
          <p>Finding good context boundaries is hard. Domain Stories can help because they show how people work together within and across subdomains – and how unsuitable boundaries prevent people from working together.</p>

        <h2>Domain Storytelling and Requirements</h2>
        <div class="ten offset-by-one columns">
          <p>The people involved in requirements elicitation have to learn and to communicate continuously. If you have read <a href="#dst-explained">Domain Storytelling Explained</a>, you saw how Domain Storytelling helps to learn domain language and to reach a shared understanding. If you are a product owner, domain expert, business analyst, or developer who has to deal with requirements, you can use Domain Storytelling...
          </p>
          <p>1. to identify weaknesses in IT-support and cooperation.
            <br />2. to visualize how the domain will change because of the software being developed.
            <br />3. as a starting point for writing down requirements.
          </p>
          <p>Domain Stories help to initially fill a product backlog with epics and user stories. The user stories can usually be derived directly from the domain stories. For example, earlierer we recorded a Domain Story about making ticket reservations. We have learned that when a customer reserves tickets on site, the cashier opens the screen plan for the show and offers seats.
From that, we can derive a high-level user story (without acceptance criteria): “As a cashier, I want to determine the free seats for a show so that I can offer these seats to my customers.”</p>
