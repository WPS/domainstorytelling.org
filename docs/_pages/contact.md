Since 2005, he has been working for [WPS – Workplace Solutions](https://www.wps.de) in Hamburg, Germany. His job there is to help teams develop software that does the right job the right way.

**Henning Schwentner** is a programmer who has been into computers ever since he got an Amiga 500 in the early 90s. He was lucky enough to turn this passion into a profession and works as a coder, coach, and consultant at [WPS – Workplace Solutions](https://www.wps.de). He helps teams to bring structure into their existing software or to build new systems with a sustainable architecture from scratch. Henning is the author of [LeasingNinja](https://leasingninja.io), the German translator of *Domain-Driven Design Distilled*, and co-organizer of [CoMoCamp](https://comocamp.org). Henning is the proud father of five children in a very special patchwork situation.
