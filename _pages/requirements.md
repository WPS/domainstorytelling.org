The people involved in requirements elicitation have to learn and to communicate continuously. If you have read the [Quick-start Guide](/quick-start-guide), you saw how Domain Storytelling helps to learn domain language and to reach a shared understanding. Sometimes, this is all that development teams need to jump directly into code. However, usually jumping from scenarios to code is a bit too challenging, and you need to bridge the gap between domain knowledge and requirements.

> You can derive requirements from domain stories so that you can discuss priorities and viable products.

In our [movie theater example](/quick-start-guide), Matthew and Anna discuss how the sales process at the box office will work in the future. They realize that the cashiers need a digital seating plan that also shows the seats sold via the app. If a moviegoer wants to buy tickets at the box office, the cashier searches for the seating plan for the show and offers the available seats. This activity must by supported by a new system:

> “As a cashier, I want to search for available seats for a show so that I can offer them to a moviegoer.”

Domain Storytelling is a helpful tool for anyone who works with requirements, whether as a product owner, product manager, business analyst, requirements engineer or cross-functional team that does its own requirements elicitation. They can all use it to...

- find out what is expected of a piece of software and
- understand the context of requirements.

Chapter 11 of the [Domain Storytelling book](/book) describes a recipe for breaking down domain stories and building a backlog of requirements with User Story Mapping.
